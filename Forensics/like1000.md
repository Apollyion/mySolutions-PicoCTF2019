__Question:__

- This _.tar file_ got tarred a lot. `1000.tar` its the file!

__Answer:__

- The `1000.tar` file was a 'Tared' filled times 1000, so extracting this manually would take too much time, so i created a _one liner_ that extracts the _tar file_ and removes the one before
- `for i in {1000..2}; do tar -xvf ${i}.tar && rm ${i-1}.tar; done` and after running it the last file has a _png_ with the flag
