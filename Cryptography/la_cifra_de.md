__Question:__

- I found this cipher in an old book. Can you figure out what it says? Connect with `nc 2019shell1.picoctf.com 37608`

__Answer:__

- Googling terms like `la cifra de "1553"` and `la cifra de "1508"` i supposed it was a Vigenere Cipher

- I used [this] (https://www.dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher) to discover the lenght of the key then entering the estimations that the key is `4` letters or `8`. The key ended up being `GFLAGFLA`, so i discovered the flag
