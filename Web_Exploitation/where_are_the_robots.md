__Question:__

- Can you find the robots? http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:32229

__Answer:__

- I read every code line and nothing so following some write-ups it seams that the site has `/robots.txt` which explains the hint _What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?_ because the site is prompting a text saying "Where are the Robots"

- After entering `http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:32229/robots.txt` it opens a site saying:
```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /0ecd0.html

```
- So conecting to `http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:32229/0ecdo0.html` it give us the flag

- robots.txt is a text that helps search engines to know what sites they should not show in a website
