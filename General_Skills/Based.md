__Question:__

- To get truly 1337, you must understand different data encodings, such as hexadecimal or binary. Can you get the flag from this program to prove you are on the way to becoming 1337? Connect with `nc 2019shell1.picoctf.com 28758`.

__Answer:__

- Used some sites to convert the inputs the `netcat` gave, it was _binary_, _octal_ and _hex_ after giving the converted results it gave me the flag
