__Question:__

- I've used a super secret mind trick to hide this file. Maybe something lies in `/problems/where-is-the-file_0_cc140a3ba634658b98122a1954c1316a`.

__Answer:__

- I used the command `cd /problems/where-is-the-file_0_cc140a3ba634658b98122a1954c1316a` on the picoCTF shell, after that i used the command `ls la`, and i saw the file _.cant_see_me_ `cat`ing it we get the flag.
