__Question:__

- Can you find the flag in file? This would be really tedious to look through manually, something tells me there is a better way.

__Answer:__

- Since is awful to look manually, i used grep to find, the command was `cat file | grep "picoCTF"`

### picoCTF{grep_is_good_to_find_things_887251c6}
